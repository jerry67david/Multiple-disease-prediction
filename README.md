# Multiple-disease-prediction

The "multiple-disease-prediction-streamlit-app" is to create a web application for predicting various diseases. 

Here's a summary of the project:

Predicts multiple diseases: The app allows users to input relevant information and receive predictions for different diseases, potentially including diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson's disease (depending on the specific implementation).

User-friendly interface: Streamlit facilitates the creation of interactive web apps, making the prediction process accessible and straightforward for users.

Machine learning models: The app leverages pre-trained machine learning models, likely trained on specific disease datasets, to generate predictions based on user-provided data.
